# Venmo â†’ Slack Integration

This implements a Venmo web hook that sends notifications of Venmo transactions to Slack.

## Quick Start

1. Set up the [Appengine SDK](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/go/download).

2. Modify `app.yaml` and change the `ADMIN` environment variable to point to a Google account
   you plan to use to configure the instance.

3. Start a copy locally to verify it runs for you:

   ```console
   $ dev_appserver.py app.yaml
   ```

4. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ to access the locally-running instance.  If you like,
   follow the configuration steps to get a sense for how you'll configure it for real.

5. If needed, create the AppEngine app:

   ```console
   $ gcloud app create
   ```

6. Deploy to AppEngine

   ```console
   $ gcloud app deploy
   ```

7. Visit the AppEngine URL for your new app and configure it.

## Configuration

Within `app.yaml` you will want to set the `ADMIN` environment variable to point to a Google
account that you plan to use to administer the instance.  Once it's running, visiting the app's
URL will guide you through the rest of the configuration.  It will entail:

### Setting up a Slack Incoming Webhook

This is how messages get delivered to Slack.  [Read more about Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).
[Set up an Incoming Webhook for your team](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/).

If desired, change the username and user icon in the Slack UI for the Incoming Webhook.

### Setting up an Access Key

The Access Key is a shared secret that is used to randomize the URL that Venmo will use to
deliver notifications to you.  We use an Access Key just to prevent people from spamming
your endpoint with bogus Venmo notifications that then get delivered as spam to Slack.

Creating an Access Key is easy: just click on the "Generate Access Key" button in the UI.

### Setting up a Venmo Webhook

Once you have an Access Key generated, the UI will give you the Webhook URL that you'll
give to Venmo.  [Sign in to your Venmo account](https://venmo.com/) and visit the
[Developer Settings](https://venmo.com/account/settings/developer) page.  Paste the Venmo
Webhook URL into this field and Save.

### Fin

At this point, you should be completely configured and notifications should be arriving in
Slack.  Send a test payment request to see them in action.
